# Friendly Collaboration Party

This repository is for planning a party to learn GitHub and more!

## About
This is some text about my project.
Parties are great right? Let me tell you how mine will be the very best.

## Team
So far my team is small - just 1 person, but I'm willing to work with you!
I'd really like for you to bring a few more people along to join in.

## Setup & Requirements
This project requires a computer and internet.

## Plan for the first party
Get going with FB.


# Craig's ideas
Hey Clair, I think what we should do is 
* meet for lunch
* gossip about Simon
* Make fun of his cat
* Be late back to work
What do you think?

# Agreed
* Plus ice cream should be involved.
* I don't like cats anyway.

### P.S. 
* I really hate cats.
